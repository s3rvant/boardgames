# Just in Time
Presentville's laboratory created a tear in space-time, trapping the city in a destructive vortex somewhere outside of reality. The players must work together, traveling through time and place, to realign their recent history before it, and they, cease to exist.

Just in Time is a cooperative time-travel game for 1 to 6 players. Players take their turns simultaneously and all win or lose as a team depending on whether they are able to successfully stabilize space-time.

## Components
* 1x Game Board
* 6x Reference cards
* 54x Player Cards - 6 decks of 9 cards
* 12x Player Meeples - 2 each
* 42x Space-Time Shard Tokens - 7 each and double-sided
* 36x Time Marker Tokens - 6 each

## Overview
Throughout the game each player controls 2 meeples: a physical meeple on places representing where they are and a temporal meeple on times representing when they are.

The game is played over 2 rounds. For each round there are specific places and times that must be aligned to proceed. Players play cards to take actions to move about the board and alter space-time shards until the required alignments are complete.

Players must successfully complete both rounds in order to win.
The players lose if all of their cards are spent without completing the second round.

## Setup
### Board & Shards
Place the game board in the center of the table within easy reach of all players.

Separate 1 of each color space-time shard for use as goal tokens. Mix the goal tokens and place them blank-side up on the 6 goal spaces: 3 for places and 3 for times.

Mix the remaining shards and randomly place 3 on each place and time. Flip all shards matching a place goal token color blank-side up and all shards matching a time goal token color distorted-side up.

### Time Markers
Place time markers on top of the shards which need to be aligned to complete the round’s goal:
* Each place matching color with a place goal token needs to contain shards matching colors with the time goal tokens; take time markers matching the time goal tokens and put them on top of the discs on each of the 3 places
* Each time matching color with a time goal token needs to contain shards matching colors with the place goal tokens; take time markers matching the place goal tokens and put them on top of the discs on each of the 3 times
* Place these time markers on top of matching colored shards where possible

If any time markers are on top of a matching colored shard that is blank-side up the shard should now be flipped to its distorted side.

**Example:**  
The goal area contains red, green and yellow tokens in the place slots as well as blue, orange and purple tokens in the time slots. Flip the red, green and yellow shards blank-side up; flip the blue, orange and purple shards distored-side up. Put a blue, orange and purple time marker on the discs in red, green and yellow places; put red, green and yellow time markers on the discs in the blue, orange and purple times. Flip any shards with matching time markers to their distorted side.

### Players
Each player chooses a color, taking the 2 matching meeples, and then places 1 of the meeples each on their matching colored time and its adjacent place. Return unused meeples to the box.

Separate the player cards into 6 decks by player color, shuffle and then divide them among the players depending on player count:
* 1 player: stack 4 decks to form a single deck
* 2 players: each player stacks 2 decks to form a single deck
* 3 players: each player stacks 1 deck on top of 3 cards from another deck (see below)
* 4 players: each player takes 1 deck
* 5 players: each player takes 1 deck removing 1 or 2 cards (see below)
* 6 players: each player takes 1 deck removing 3 cards (see below)

Return unused cards to the game box; they will not be used.

Players place their decks face-down in front of them and draw a hand of 3 cards.

Note that cards are numbered from 1-9 on their fronts; for 3, 5 and 6 player games make these adjustments to the player decks:

**3 Players**

- Player 1 adds cards 1, 5 and 9
- Player 2 adds cards 3, 4 and 8
- Player 3 adds cards 2, 6 and 7

**5 Players**

- Player 1 removes cards 5 and 7
- Player 2 removes cards 4 and 8
- Player 3 removes card 3
- Player 4 removes cards 2 and 6
- Player 5 removes cards 1 and 9

**6 Players**

- Players 1 and 2 remove cards 3, 5 and 7
- Players 3 and 4 remove cards 2, 4 and 9
- Players 5 and 6 remove cards 1, 6 and 8

## Game Play
### Existance
Time has looped back on itself, meaning that a player's distant future is also their past. The time that a player’s temporal meeple sits on is their present. The 2 times counter-clockwise from that space are in their past and the remaining 3 times are in their future.

Players will be taking actions to affect shards however may only do so if they exist for that player. A shard exists for a player if its color matches one of the player’s past or present times. Each time space has 3 colored bars showing the 3 colors that exist for meeples on that space.

### Goal Tokens
The 6 goal tokens represent part of space-time that has become unstable. Of these, 3 represent places and the other 3 represent times.

In order to complete the round, players must change the shards on the places matching the goal tokens to contain the shard colors listed on the time goal and change the shards on the times matching the goal tokens to contain the shard colors listed on the place goal. The time markers help track this.

### Distortion
In addition to specific places and times containing specific colored shards the shards themselves must not be distorted; they do not count toward completing the current round. Distorted shards can however be flipped to their blank side through player actions.

### Stability
Each time a shard is aligned by flipping or swapping so that it is blank and matches color with a time marker in its space:
* The player to complete the alignment takes the shard to spend later
* The time marker is moved to the bottom-most available stability slot in its respective place

These steps must be completed immediately; they cannot be delayed to rewind first (see Rewind below).

## Actions
Players each simultaneously either selects 1 of their shards or 1 card from their hand. Once all players are ready they each reveal their choice resolving shards first and then cards in order to take their actions. Shards are used to rewind time while cards each have 2 actions available and when played only 1 of the actions is chosen and resolved. Any players without cards must select a shard if able; otherwise they lose their turn (see End Game below).

### Rewind
Before any card actions are resolved any player who selected a shard for their turn now rewinds time. The benefit from rewinding time decreases over the course of the game depending on how many time markers have stabilized at that player's current place:
* 0-2 time markers: return the top card from the player's present time place as well as both past time places
* 3-5 time markers: return only the top cards from both of the player's past time places (not present)
* 6 time markers: cannot rewind time

To rewind time the player discards their shard to the game box and then takes cards as indicated above and then returns them to their owning players who place those cards on the bottom of their deck.

### Card Actions
Each player that selected a card chooses 1 of the 2 actions to resolve as specified below. After resolving the chosen action the card is discarded directly to the game board on one of the USED slots. For place effects discard the card to the slot on the player’s physical meeple’s place; for time effects discard the card to the slot on the player’s temporal meeple’s place. The player then draws cards from their deck to refill their hand to 3 cards.

There are 3 different card actions each with a place and time variation as well as a special action that can be taken:

**Flip**  
Flip a shard on your physical meeple’s place to blank-side up  
Flip a shard on your temporal meeple’s time to blank-side up

The shard must exist, i.e., match color with one of the player’s past or present times.

**Move**  
Move your physical meeple to an adjacent place  
Move your temporal meeple to an adjacent time

**Swap**  
Swap a shard from the player’s physical meeple’s place with a shard from their temporal meeple’s time  
Swap a shard from the player’s temporal meeple’s place with a shard from their physical meeple’s place

The originating shard must exist in order to be swapped, i.e., match color with one of the player’s past or present times; the destination shard may be any color.

**Special Action: Brainstorm**  
Instead of resolving an action on the player's chosen card they may discard the card to their physical meeple’s place in order to place their other 2 cards on the bottom of their deck.

## End Game
If all players run out of cards and shards they lose the game forever lost as Presentville’s space-time ceases to exist.

Otherwise the players continue to take actions until the 1st goal has been completed at which point they perform the following setup for the 2nd goal:
* Swap the 3 place goal tokens with the 3 time goal tokens
* Flip all remaining shards to their distorted side that match any of the new time goal token colors
* Place time markers on each of the shards according to the new goal

Players continue taking actions until the 2nd goal has been completed ending the game in victory for the players, saving Presentville, as place and time restore to their rightful ways.

## Adjust Difficulty
The cards granted from rewinding time can be adjusted to either relax or further challenge the efficiency needed while playing the game:

**Easier**
* 0-5 time markers: return the top card from the player's present time place as well as both past time places

**Harder**
* 0-5 time markers: return only the top cards from both of the player's past time places (not present)

**Impossible?**
* 3-5 time markers: return only the top cards from both of the player's past time places (not present)
* 0-2 time markers: return only the top card from the player's present time place (not past)
