# Rulebook Changelog
## Version 26
* During setup any matching time markers and shards now cause shards to flip to their distorted side instead of swapping with adjacent spaces
* Shards are now played instead of a card as the player's entire turn and these resolve prior to cards that turn
* Turning in a shard now returns the top card from the player's present time and their two past times
* Removed sharing of shards now that they return cards to their owning player
* Adjusted which cards are returned from rewinding time based on time markers
* Provided difficulty adjustments using tweaks to the rewind action for balance
