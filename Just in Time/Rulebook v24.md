# Just in Time
Presentville's laboratory created a tear in space-time, trapping the city in a destructive vortex somewhere outside of reality. The players must work together, traveling through time and place, to realign their recent history before it, and they, cease to exist.

Just in Time is a cooperative time-travel game for 1 to 4 players. Players take their turns simultaneously and will all win or lose as a team depending on whether they are able to successfully stabilize space-time.

## **Components**
* 1x Game Board
* 36x Player Cards
* 12x Player Meeples - 2 each
* 42x Space-Time Shard Tokens - 7 each and double-sided
* 36x Time Marker Tokens - 6 each

---

## **Overview**
Throughout the game each player controls 2 meeples: a physical meeple on places representing where they are and a temporal meeple on times representing when they are.

The game is played over 2 rounds. For each round there are specific places and times that must be aligned to proceed. Players play cards to take actions to move about the board and alter space-time shards until the required alignments are complete.

Players must successfully complete both rounds in order to win.
The players lose if all of their cards are spent without completing both rounds.

## **Setup**
### **Board & Shards**  
Place the game board in the center of the table within easy reach of all players.

Separate 1 of each color space-time shard for use as goal tokens. Mix the goal tokens and place them blank-side up on the 6 goal spaces: 3 for places and 3 for times.

Mix the remaining shards and randomly place 3 on each place and time with all shards matching a place goal token color being blank-side up and all shards matching a time goal token color being flipped to their distorted side.

### **Time Markers**  
Place time markers on top of the shards which need to be aligned to complete the round’s goal:
* Each place matching color with a place goal token needs to contain shards matching colors with the time goal tokens; take time markers matching the time goal tokens and put them on top of the discs on each of the 3 places
* Each time matching color with a time goal token needs to contain shards matching colors with the place goal tokens; take time markers matching the place goal tokens and put them on top of the discs on each of the 3 times
* Place these time markers on top of matching colored shards where possible

If any time markers are on top of a matching colored shard that is blank-side up it should now be swapped with a shard in a nearby space (place or time) so that no such matches remain; matching color with a distorted shard is okay.

**Example:**  
The goal area contains green, yellow and red tokens in the place slots as well as purple, blue and orange tokens in the time slots. Put a purple, blue and orange timer marker on the discs in green, yellow and red places. Then put green, yellow and red time markers on the discs in the purple, blue and orange times.

### **Players**  
Each player chooses a color, taking the 2 matching meeples, and then places 1 of the meeples each on their matching colored time and its adjacent place. Return unused meeples to the box.

Separate the player cards into 4 decks containing 1 of each of the 9 unique cards, shuffle and then divide them among the players:
* 4 players: Each player takes 1 deck
* 3 players: Evenly divide 1 deck among the players then each player stacks 1 deck on top
* 2 players: Each player stacks 2 decks together
* 1 player: The player stacks all 4 decks together

Note that in a 3-player game the 4th deck should be divided such that each set of 3 cards should have 1 of each action available among its 6 actions.

Players place their decks face-down in front of them and draw a hand of 5 cards.

## **Game Play**
### **Existance**
Time has looped back on itself, meaning that a player's distant future is also their past. The time that a player’s temporal meeple sits on is their present. The 2 times counter-clockwise from that space are in their past and the remaining 3 times are in their future.

Most actions require a shard to exist for the player in order to be affected. A shard exists for a player if its color matches one of the player’s past or present times. Each time space has 3 colored bars showing the 3 colors that exist for meeples on that space.

### **Goal Tokens**
The 6 goal tokens represent part of space-time that has become unstable. Of these, 3 represent places and the other 3 represent times.

In order to complete the round, players must change the shards on the places matching the goal tokens to contain the shard colors listed on the time goal and change the shards on the times matching the goal tokens to contain the shard colors listed on the place goal. The time markers help track this.

### **Distortion**
In addition to specific places and times containing specific colored shards the shards themselves must not be distorted; they do not count toward completing the current round. Distorted shards can however be flipped to their blank side through player actions.

### **Stability**
Each time a shard is aligned by flipping or swapping so that it is blank and matches color with a time marker in its space:
* The player to complete the alignment takes the shard to spend later
* The time marker is moved to the bottom-most available stability slot in its respective place

These steps must be completed immediately; they cannot be delayed to rewind first.

Cards that have been discarded can be picked back up again by rewinding time by any player. Players can discard one of their shards to the box in order to move the top 2 discarded cards from their physical meeple’s place to the top of their deck.

However, as time markers are moved to the places the time on that place begins to stabilize making it more difficult to rewind. Once a place has 3 time markers, covering a draw icon, players can only rewind 1 card from that place. Similarly once a place has all 6 time markers, covering both draw icons, players can no longer rewind time at that place.

## **Actions**
Players each simultaneously select 1 card from their hand. Once all players are ready they each play their card and take their actions. Each card has 2 actions available; when played only 1 of the actions is chosen and resolved. Any players without cards remaining can not take card actions.

After resolving the chosen action the card is discarded directly to the game board on one of the USED slots. For place effects discard the card to the slot on the player’s physical meeple’s place; for time effects discard the card to the slot on the player’s temporal meeple’s time. The player then draws cards from their deck to refill their hand to 5 cards.

There are 3 card actions with place and time variations as well as 3 special actions that can be taken between turns:

### **Card Actions**
**Flip**  
Flip a shard on your physical meeple’s place to blank-side up  
Flip a shard on your temporal meeple’s time to blank-side up

The shard must exist, i.e., match color with one of the player’s past or present times.

**Move**  
Move your physical meeple to an adjacent place  
Move your temporal meeple to an adjacent time

**Swap**  
Swap a shard from the player’s physical meeple’s place with a shard from their temporal meeple’s time  
Swap a shard from the player’s temporal meeple’s place with a shard from their physical meeple’s place

The originating shard must exist in order to be swapped, i.e., match color with one of the player’s past or present times; the destination shard may be any color.

### **Special Actions**
**Brainstorm**  
Instead of resolving an action on the player's chosen card they may discard the card to their physical meeple’s place in order to place their other 4 cards on the bottom of their deck.

**Rewind**  
Players may discard a shard they have gained in order to draw cards from the top of the used pile in their current place depending on how many time markers have been stabilized on that place:
* 0-2 time markers: draw 2 cards
* 3-5 time markers: draw 1 card
* 6 time markers: cannot draw cards

**Share**  
Players may pass cards and shards to another player so long as their physical meeples are in the same place and the receiving player's temporal meeple is in a time that exists for the gifting player.

## **End Game**
If the players run out of cards they lose the game forever lost as Presentville’s space-time ceases to exist.

Otherwise the players continue to take actions until the 1st goal has been completed at which point they perform the following setup for the 2nd goal:
* Swap the 3 place goal tokens with the 3 time goal tokens
* Flip all remaining shards to their distorted side that match any of the new time goal token colors
* Place time markers on each of the shards according to the new goal

Players continue taking actions until the 2nd goal has been completed ending the game in victory for the players, saving Presentville, as place and time restore to their rightful ways.
