Base game idea is a dungeon crawler featuring merging cards and deckbuilding using a variation on my chaining mechanic for taking actions.

Player and enemy characters will be cards in standees that can merge with gear cards to gain chain icons.

At start of player's turn they generate a colored token for each icon on their character and can discard cards to generate tokens by the card's main color.

Cards can be played by spending a token matching its main color as well as boosted by spending token(s) of secondary color(s).

Cards can be purchased by spending sets of tokens matching color with set size determining what tier of card can be purchased (1-2-3).

2 tokens of any color can be exchanged for 1 of desired color.

Playing a card generates 1-2 tokens different from main color and boost options will also be 1-2 colors.

Tier 1 cards provide 1 link color and 1 boost option; tier 2 will have either a 2nd link color or a 2nd boost option; tier 3 will have both 2 link colors and 2 boost options.

Equipment will provide 1-2-3 color icons depending if tier 1-2-3 respectively.

Equipment slots are head, body and legs.

Tier of equipment will increase features such as tier 1 being just a weapon while tier 3 would be weapon, offhand and armor.
