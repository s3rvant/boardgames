**Original notes**

Protoplanets was originally designed to make use of a 2x2x2 Rubik's cube as its center-piece moving around a 4x4 board in an L-pattern causing each of the cube's sides to face upward exactly once as well as face each player exactly once. The game used these colors to fuel a "roll-n-write" style game themed around merging bits of space rock into protoplanets with rings, moons, etc. to score points.

After pitching (and not succeeding) to Rubik's themselves I'm reworking this one to use a clear cube case holding 8 dice as a new type of randomizer providing a similar center piece. I also plan to pull in a different mechanic I've been trying to make use of via custom-cut cards that can literally merge together (up to 3 cards into 1) while again making use of the exposed dice faces to trigger various effects in game.
