# Leap Frog
A micro dexterity game for 2-4 players in 10 minutes inspired by the Japanese sport of pole toppling.

## Components
* 12 discs: 3 each of blue, green, red and yellow
* 4 poles
* 4 reference cards

## Setup
1. Select a play surface; ideally a smooth table or play mat 2-3' per side
2. Each player selects a color and places their discs along the edge of the play surface closest to themselves so that their unmarked side is face-up
3. Hand each player a pole and reference card to keep nearby
4. Return unused discs, poles and cards to the game box

## Gameplay
Players take turns flicking 1 of their discs and/or attempting to score:

### Flicking
1. The player selects 1 of their empty discs (no pole on top) and flicks it with the goal of setting up a scoring attempt
2. If the flicked disc leaves the play surface it is returned to the edge nearest that player, do not move their pole, otherwise move their pole on top of the flicked disc

Should a pole be knocked down put it back on top of the same disc.

Should another disc be knocked out of play return it to the edge closest to its owner; if it had a pole on top move the pole to another of that player's discs that are not currently on the surface edge if available.

### Scoring
The player may attempt to score either after their flick or in place of their flick:
* To make an attempt there must be an empty disc between the player's disc and another disc which has a pole on top of it; these can be of any color
* The player lays their card sideways with the center of 1 edge resting on the empty disc such that it creates a ramp
* The player then flicks their disc with the goal of traveling up the ramp and colliding with the pole knocking it over

The disc must remain airborne and hit the pole itself to count; bouncing off the play surface or knocking over the pole by colliding with its disc invalidates the attempt.

When successful the player flips the disc over to its marked side; this disc cannot be used for future scoring attempts.

## Game End
As soon as a player successfully scores for a 2nd time they immediately win the game.
