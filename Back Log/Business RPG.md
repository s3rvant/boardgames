# Business RPG
Pre-covid I played my fair share of tabletop RPG's and have been fascinated with the ones able to cram a lot of interest in a small package such as The Wildlings where both the GM and players could jump into the game rather quickly without needing to read a novel beforehand.

Once such idea included printing notes on business cards to easily fit in the GM's wallet to break out whenever / where ever and immediately tucked that idea away to revisit at some point. Then I came across a maze generator which triggered the thought:

What if I developed a program that could output a simple map, some premade characters / enemies / items and some story that could print on a sheet of business cards? HP, mana etc. could be represented by tabs torn into the cards (and torn off when lost) with die rolls being a mod-5 hand throw between the GM and player: both reveal 1-5 fingers then take the sum (or subtract 5 if sum is over 5) as the roll result. Back of map cards would have some story and then GM would reveal the 1st tile of the map saving back the others until the players reached those points.
