# Drone Racing
Simple dexterity game where goal is to be the first player to throw a paper airplane through a series of cardboard loops and come to rest in the game box

Includes instructions for various paper airplanes with their pros / cons as well as how to adjust wings for specific curved throws

Box includes several cardboard loops (squares with bracing) to place around the room / house to build the course

Rulebook of course also comes with several recommended course layouts

Inspired by Mars Open and common yard games involving throwing with desire to have something to play indoors

Some component tweaks might include paperclips for nose of plane, craft sticks to add weight to body, weight on string to add a pendulum obstacle, etc.

Initial prototype functions fairly well:

This model plane was folded from a full sheet and is easy to tweak wing tips for curved flights however it is physically large so not much room for error even with the large box

I plan to make a few more boxes same size for now and then test various plane models / sizes

Control-line airplanes have a dogfight mode where a ribbon is attached to tail and goal is to get close enough to use propeller to snip at opponent's ribbon

Maybe I include some chipboard discs to mark where each player landed and you get some bonus if you pass through loop AND touch a disc as you land
