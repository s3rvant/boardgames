# Pandora's Box
Been on a Button Shy / plan-in-hand kick lately so of course than means tinkering with 18-card designs and ideally do not need a surface to play on

Was originally thinking about a minimal dungeon run however Mini Rogue is already pretty good (not to mention Gloomholdin') so exploring other ideas instead

One thought that came to mind was a Deck of Many Things which led me to thinking of Pandora's Box

I'm thinking the 18-card deck could have a dedicated top / bottom card with images of the top / bottom of the box and player begins the game by "opening the box" to which of course triggers an onslaught of all sorts of random encounters

Cards would be double-sided and likely double-ended with certain cards prompting the player to splay them in various ways

Goal would be to get all the stuff back into the box again before some loss condition occurs

Perhaps some mechanic at start of game that reveals a goal such as needing to remove a specific item from the box AND then close the box to win

For the "specific card" requirement can have 1 face use black border and other a white border with 2 icons in corner (circle, plus, triangle, square) where player splays top 2 cards after "opening pandora's box" to reveal the target card:

Top card determines 1st icon, next card determines 2nd icon and then compare border colors of both to determine target border color:

If top 2 cards have same border then target is white border otherwise target is black border

Thinking card effects could focus on forced / optional card manipulation like "splay next card to the left"

Card could be righted by overlapping a card in same splay direction that shares an icon

Right the entire deck to close it

Perhaps white side of card has effects that right the cards and the above icon match boths rights and flips the cards to seek out those white sides

Sort of a "Lights Out" feel though I'd like it to ramp up as deck improves - definitely want to avoid a never-ending loop

Maybe the box bottom acts as a timer so each time it's encountered it rotates / flips counting down like 8 rounds or something at which point the box breaks and player loses
