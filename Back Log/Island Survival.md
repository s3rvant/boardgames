# Island Survival
* 2 player hand-management card-game played entirely in hand
* The players have become stranded on an uninhabited island however they are NOT friendly and have decided to make camp on opposite sides of the island
* Cards will be double-sided with available resources, craftable items and other tasks the players can take toward their own survival
* Players will have a hand of several cards (idk how many yet) however will only splay 5 (or so) at once to work with
* The side of card facing the player represents resources close to that player's camp and are usable without any further action
* The cards held by the opponent will only display part of the available resources and represent items further away that could be explored and gathered
* When gathering the player takes the card from the opponent, maintaining its orientation and adds it to their hand
* When crafting the player rotates the card containing the crafting plan to the other end to reveal the crafted item - the item and any other cards used for their resources are moved to the back of that player's hand so they are no longer splayed (item takes time to craft and resources need time to regrow etc.)
* Will likely have some divider cards in the player's hand to allow zones such as completely spent cards or cards that only come out in future rounds such as wildlife to hunt
* One of the divider cards will be a timer of sorts requiring the player to be able to eat/drink/shelter or some mix of those in order to remain alive
* Perhaps each missing requirement of the 3 results in moving a splayed card to back of hand without splaying a replacement thus shrinking the player's options - reaching zero splayed cards would result in that player's loss
* I think keeping game to 54 cards including dividers and rules would make it as portable as I'm after
* If I have 1 player splay left and other player splay right I bet I could set it up asynchronously with face of cards 1 color and backs another to tell them apart and setup some fun interactions that way; also makes it like the island has actual different sides rather than being mirrored
