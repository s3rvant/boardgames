# Dice System
Latest Omnibus article by Cardboard Edison discussed gaming systems including Knot Dice with its Celtic theme. This got me thinking about what other dice-based gaming systems might already exist beyond just simple pips and found chess dice, letter dice and poker dice. Was hoping for something more unique like the Knot Dice but with more iconography to support a greater variety of games such as a classic Poker card deck.

Since I've not found what I'm looking for of course that means I'm now brainstorming a dice set myself ðŸ˜‰

Initial thoughts are 24 dice (divides several ways) likely with same 6 faces on each but a couple other indicators such as differing border lines on the faces or a smaller secondary icon in the corner allowing each face to be unique within the overall set. This quantity should also fit in a case of similar size to a deck of cards allowing for ease of travel which I want to prioritize. Depending on final design these may even tie into Protoplanets to supply 8 dice for its central cube and the remaining dice split 4 per player toward a roll-n-write or similar.

For now I'm mostly just mulling over ideas toward how I want to work these such as total variety of faces etc. and once happy will start branching out toward designing some initial games that can be played with them.

Currently leaning on rather elaborate dice such as the elemental dice in Mercurial

24 dice total  
6 suites marked as a small corner icon  
4 values indicated by side line art around edges  
6 faces (leaning towards using elements) common to all 24 dice

So a total of 144 unique faces though games could focus just on suit/value or value/face etc. for the combinations needed by the rule set

For initial theme I'm thinking of going with dinosaurs for the faces, fossils for the suit (mud print in corner) and small pip marks for rank; e.g., this is rank 4

Now with color: Hollow Bone - rank 2 - triceratops
