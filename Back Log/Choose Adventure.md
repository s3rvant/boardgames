# Choose Adventure
I've always been a fan of Choose Your Own Adventure books and managed to nab several of the D&D Endless Quest series some months back. Recently while browsing for other options I came across Into the Dungeon which not only features choosing your path but also a basic character sheet with random stats and the ability to pick up and use items while reading through the story.

This got me thinking how I might take this a step further: rather than having Choice A take you to page X and Choice B to page Y I think the player sheet could include page references that could be modified, e.g., Choice A takes you to B3 where your B3 could currently be page X but later change to page Y such as completing a quest for an NPC should remove that quest option from the dialog or unlock additional dialog options.

I've never written a book before so would be a big undertaking however I do believe I could start with the underlying outline and then go back to flesh out the story once I have a more solid foundation.

While talking with another designer who's working on a choose-your-own-path project got an idea to build off one of their mechanics:

Some of the page labels will store numbers that options will use later; for example lets say a player chooses to buy an artifact and book instructs to update the values for 4-5 different labels as a result

Then later in story player gets told that if they choose path 1 to go to page A+B where A would be their normal choice target and B would hold a variable for whether or not they have the artifact

Idea here being that a reader couldn't cheat the system when it's worded like "if you have artifact go to B otherwise go to A"

Also lets me have more states without having to branch as often so instead of 4 different pages to present 2 choices I could do it in 2 pages and let 2nd choice point to page A+B
