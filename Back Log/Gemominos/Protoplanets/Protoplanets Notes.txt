convert any 2 dice into a wild

only debris generates rocks (not dice)

subtract 2 points per unused asteroid

maybe require asteroid for absorbing rather than rocks



Print-n-play requiring 2x2 puzzle cube


Roll the 4 colored dice pictured on top of cube

Staggered track for each color:

. . . .
 . . . .
 
Circle the 4 from tracks matching your own side as debris in your area

X them off as obsorbed by your planet

Larger circle if 3 of same debris are un-X'd at same time forming larger body

Use larger bodies for moons / rings however lose the game if any remain at end (or just major negative)

Smaller debris can used for minior upgrades like mass / magnetism

Need certain amounts of mass / magnetism in order to hold on to moons / rings

Can still use moon / ring action if not enough mass / magnetism but it just remove debris from area
- no points in this case





mark what sides are available each turn; X when used

"Connect the dots" art as completing upgrades




2 colors each for gas, liquid and solid

score multipliers for life support (air, water), distinctive features (moon/ring) and...




1. generate debris - required to circle matching dots
2. assign dice - action, matching debris or half other debris (round up)
3. resolve actions - increase mass last
4. merge asteroids - 3 of same size merge; 2nd merge = new protoplanet (big negative points)
